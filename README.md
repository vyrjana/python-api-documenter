# python-api-documenter

**NO LONGER UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT/MAINTENANCE**

A package for conveniently generating documentation of a Python API through introspection.
Previously used by the following projects:

- [pyimpspec](https://github.com/vyrjana/pyimpspec)
- [DearEIS](https://github.com/vyrjana/DearEIS)

**WARNING!** The API and its functionality may change significantly so if you use this package, then you should probably set up a script to checkout a specific tag or commit when recreating a development environment that makes use of this package.
